# FailToCapture

- I have one problem.
- It means that I can't take pictures with HoloLens 2 only with apps made with Unity.
- It works fine with screenshots and the store app's camera.
- I already checked Unity's project setting->player->publisher setting-> webcam is on, publisher mode is on both DeskTop and HL2, HL2's setting->privacy->camera is on
- I have been suffering from this problem for a month.
- Thank you for reading and waiting for your response.
